OpenAI Agents Repository

This repository serves as a collection of projects leveraging the OpenAI Agents SDK to build advanced multi-agent workflows and autonomous systems.

🚀 Overview

This repository contains various implementations using the OpenAI Agents SDK, a lightweight yet powerful framework for designing and managing AI agents. It enables scalable and efficient multi-agent systems capable of handling complex tasks through coordinated interactions.

✨ Features

Intelligent Agents: Custom-configured LLMs with specific instructions and capabilities.

Seamless Handoffs: Coordinated task transfers between specialized agents.

Built-in Safety: Implemented guardrails for input/output validation.

Advanced Tracing: Comprehensive tracking system for debugging and optimization.

Memory & Context Management: Agents retain context across multiple interactions.

Adaptive Reasoning: Agents dynamically adjust their approach based on real-time feedback.

Parallel Execution: Efficiently runs multiple agent workflows concurrently.
